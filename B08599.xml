            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIrſt, the true deſcription of <hi>Hingſton-downe,</hi> lieth in Longitude <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> five Miles, with Millions of Shafts that have been viſibly Sunck upon ſeveral loads of Mettall, by the <hi>Romans, Danes, Saxons, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Britans,</hi> And is in breadth 700 Fatham, at the <hi>Baſis</hi> lying <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> as well as in depth 200 Fatham from the <hi>Becon</hi> perpendicular to the <hi>Center</hi> of that addit now intended.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The reaſon why I undertake a work of this nature, and in theſe parts, is as followeth;</head>
               <p>FIrſt, the Ambition of gratitude to anſwer his Highneſs Heroick truſt, repoſed in me to diſcover this Nations Minerall Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, my obliged fidelity, to my Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> to practice this his Philoſophical invention, for the general good; and in particular to give new birth to the drooping conditions of my fellow Pupills, the poor Miners drowned and deſerted works.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, my Cordial deſire to ſerve theſe <hi>Weſterne</hi> parts with the benefit of ſo uſefull a preſident, I having already practiſed the ſame in <hi>Wales,</hi> and found the fruitfull effects thereof.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Secondly, the reaſons why I begin my Addit or Aqueducts, from Smal-Coome and Hooke-Coome, to meet underneath the <hi>Becon</hi> at the aforeſaid <hi>Center, is;</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, becauſe theſe Coomes lying loweſt equall with my addits, all the water that ſhall fall from the ſuperficies being 200 Fatham perpendicular to the levell of my ſaid Addits, may by that meanes be eaſily conveyed away.</p>
               <p>Secondly by mine own experience, I found not any of our predeceſſors to ſearch lower then 40 Fatham. So that I am confidently aſſured that cutting <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> thorough the aforeſaid 700 Fatham, I ſhall command all the Loads, Rakes, and Veins of Mettal in that Hill, which is conjectured by the multitude of Shafts upon the ſuperficies to run five Miles in length as aforeſaid; and how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then may it be to reedifie a ſecond <hi>Indies</hi> out of the drowned and deſerted works of our Nation by this example, I ſhall leave to the rational Judgments of them who are practitioners in thoſe affairs; Eſpecially whither theſe mine endeavors will not give much hopes to verifie the old proverb in this age of ours, <hi>Hingston downe well wrought, is worth London towne dearely bought.</hi> For if the riches of thoſe Groves in 40 Fatham ſinking hath occaſioned the aforeſaid proverb, as well as the inundation of water hath cauſed them to deſert from their Mineral profit, it cannot be denied by common ſenſe, or rules of reaſon, this addit undermining moſt of the ſaid works 150 Fatham, and then aſcending up into their ſeveral loads of Metal, to draine the waters in their old Groves, but that it carries the faireſt encouragement of probable conjecture to make good the true riches of the old proverb of Hingſton downe, in this age of ours.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The reaſon why I uſe Pipe and Bellows, is,</head>
               <p>FIrſt, to convey Aire into the innermoſt part of my Addit without the ſinking of Airy Shafts, and preventing the vaſt expence and tediouſneſs of time, which cauſed our Forefathers being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this invention, to leave ſuch ſuppoſed riches of hidden Treaſure to us their poſterity.</p>

               <head>The reaſon why I make my Addit or Aqueducts open <hi>150</hi> Fatham at each end, is,</head>
               <p>FIrſt, to facilitate the diſpatch of 300 Fatham of the 700 the firſt year, by the reaſon of the multitude of hands that may be ſet on work, which will not be admitted if cloſe, and likewiſe it being the ſhalloweſt place of the Hill, it will require but the ſame expence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the cloſe Addit may be but in length 400 Fatham of the 700. and to ſhorten likewiſe the drift of the ſame in point of time, I begin my Addits at each end of my open Trench as Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drifts to meet each other, And ſo conſequently the whole will be diſpatched in halfe the time; And therefore you may reſt aſſured that I have ſo maturely Calculated the waies and means, not onely of this great work at <hi>Hingſton-down,</hi> but alſo of that of <hi>Coom-Martin</hi> in <hi>Devon, Guinop</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and <hi>Mondy</hi> in <hi>Summerſet,</hi> that I doubt not, but in 4 years to ſet a period to all expectations, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>FIrſt, becauſe it drawes the inundation of Water from the whole Hill, and conveying the more plenty of Aire into the leſſer Addits, which muſt follow the loads of Mettall when we croſs them in our common ſhore or principall Addit, as alſo to prevent thoſe Damps that frequently ariſe from the ſulphurous nature of the earth at that Center.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, becauſe I have found by mine own experience in cutting thorough other Mountaines of the like nature, the great inconvenience of little Addits, in reſpect of the aforeſaid reaſons, and likewiſe the prejudice I have received in being careleſs of loſing a foot in the levell, when I met with the ſeveral Loads and Veins of Mettall.</p>
